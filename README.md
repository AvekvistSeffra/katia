# Katia
Katia [ k√¶ti:a ] is an application to implement most things that are good about [Roll20](https://roll20.net) as well as [DnDBeyond](https://dndbeyond.com) but also improve on their ideas. 
The project is open source so anyone is free to edit and do what they want with it, just follow the license and I'm happy. 

## Running
The idea is that when the project is far along, it will support executables and will exist under [releases](https://github.com/AvekvistSeffra/katia/releases). 
The project is currently in too early development to support any executables. 

## Features
It's best to check under [projects](https://github.com/AvekvistSeffra/katia/projects) to see the planned features and the [wiki](https://github.com/AvekvistSeffra/katia/wiki) to see the existing features. 
Everything will be updated as the project moves on but if there is a feature that isn't documented, feel free to write about it yourself. Every contribution is appreciated. 

## Issues
If you've been using the app and noticed a problem, feel free to note it under [issues](https://github.com/AvekvistSeffra/katia/issues) and I'll take a look at it as soon as possible. 
Feature requests are also allowed under issues, especially if you describe it thoroughly. If I close an issue related to a feature request, that means it's added to [projects](https://github.com/AvekvistSeffra/katia/projects). 

## Contributing
Implement a feature or fix a bug in a fork and make a pull request. You can also send me a message and tell me that you're interested in working on this. 
I'm up for every type of discussion and help is always welcome.
